## Project Outline
In this project, we practiced the following skills.

1. Declaring variables with let and const.
1. Writing functions.
1. Function parameters and arguments.
1. Iteration with for loops and/or forEach array methods.
1. Modular development to enforce the Single Responsibiity Principle to your code.
1. Using import and export keywords between modules.
1. Conditional logic using if and else.

## My Goals
I wanted to understand the step-by-step on gettting through an array method and using if/else.
